This is a guide and build log on how I built my own version of Eddie's Kramer Frankenstrat! This was my first guitar that I've built from scratch and a lot was learned in the build process. The final product ended up being such a killer axe with tons of playability! Growing up being an avid listener of Van Halen and being a big reason that I picked up guitar, I knew that if there was any guitar that I would try to build it would be Eddie Van Halen's Frankenstrat. My inspiration for it all was seeing Eddie’s Kramer 5150 in the [Van Halen Live Without a Net Eruption video]( https://youtu.be/mIpHZo7BsT8?si=noNRfv9UKynxgA3a). That guitar looked so unique and has a huge sound. Since I loved how the original Frankenstrat looked I decided to put the two together and create something different than all of the other builds I see online. So after long months of research and planning for the best parts, I finally have a finished product that plays better than I could have ever imagined!

# Parts List with Part Selection Supplement
For this build, I was not going for a complete 1:1 recreation of the original guitar because I wanted something that resembled the original guitar but with certain additional parts that I would want on a guitar. 

## Body
While there is information online about what wood the original frankenstrat body was made from, there seems to be speculation that the wood was swamp ash, northern ash, or basswood. Since I did not know for sure, I ended up choosing swamp ash because after checking out videos on those three tonewoods, I eded up liking that sound the best. I chose swamp ash for its very resonant, strong, and sustain compared to other tonewoods. 

I chose an [eBay seller who fabricates custom guitar bodies](https://www.ebay.com/itm/326187569782) as this route was hundreds cheaper than buying a swamp ash body from a retailer.

## Hardware
For the various hardware on the guitar, parts like the pickguard were chosen to replicate the original look, while others like the tuners, toggle switch, etc were chosen based off of preference.

- [Strap Buttons]( https://www.ebay.com/itm/363382539717) 
- [3-way Selector Switch]( https://www.ebay.com/itm/112206021973)

- [Fender American Tuners]( https://www.ebay.com/itm/401133273129) 
- [Pickguard Screws]( https://www.ebay.com/itm/116208882312) 
- [Fender Neck Plate]( https://www.ebay.com/itm/196266445491)
  
## Neck
Just like with the body, it was actually hundreds cheaper to custom order a Kramer style hockeystick neck than it was to buy from a retailer. Especially since that type of headstock is more rare, the market price can get very high for these. I ended up ordering a custom neck from [Musikraft](https://musikraft.com/product/banana-neck-custom-build/) tailored to my preferred specifications:

- Head Shape: Holy Grail
- Scale Length: 25.5"
- Nut Width: 1-11/16" (42.8mm)
- Floyd Nut Rear Mounting Holes
- 2-1/4" (57.2mm) Heel Width (Go with Fender standard width for more compatibility) 
- Dual Acting Truss Rod @ Head
- Maple Fretboard
- 12" Neck Radius
- 055 Nickel Silver Frets (Medium Tall)
- Walnut Skunk Stripe
- MK Custom EVH 81 91 Back Profile
- Oil Finish (Same as Fender)
- Neck Holes with Standard Fender Pattern

## Tremolo
The original frankenstrat and Kramer had a Floyd Rose Original tremolo. While this tremolo is tried and true, the price is super high. Though, a guitar parts company Gotoh produces a Floyd Rose clone with notable improvements and full compatibility to the orgiginal Floyd as less than half the price. From my usage so far, the tremolo usit hold tune very well, even under the most extreme divebombs. Included below is also the locking nut needed and the EVH D-Tuna for on the fly drop D tuning without unscrewing the nut.

## Electronics
### Pickups
For the humbucker pickup, I ended up going with the Seymour-Duncan SH-11 Custom Custom as it was the same model that was inside Eddie's 80's Kramer guitar. For the red phenolic pickup in the neck, the original frankenstrat did not have it wired properly so it never worked. In my case, I bought a working pickup that I could wire to a toggle switch for more tonal possibilities.

### Switches
The original frankenstrat had a 3 way pickup selector in the middle position on the guitar body, this did not acttualy serve a purpose other than cosmetic. To make use of the neck pickup, I wired in a black 3 way toggle switch used in Les Paul guitars for more tonal possibilities.
