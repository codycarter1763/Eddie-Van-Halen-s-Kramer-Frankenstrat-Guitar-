This is a guide and build log on how I built my own version of Eddie's Kramer Frankenstrat! This was my first guitar that I've built from scratch and a lot was learned in the build process. The final product ended up being such a killer axe with tons of playability! Growing up being an avid listener of Van Halen and being a big reason that I picked up guitar, I knew that if there was any guitar that I would try to build it would be Eddie Van Halen's Frankenstrat. My inspiration for it all was seeing Eddie’s Kramer 5150 in the [Van Halen Live Without a Net Eruption video]( https://youtu.be/mIpHZo7BsT8?si=noNRfv9UKynxgA3a). That guitar looked so unique and has a huge sound. Since I loved how the original Frankenstrat looked I decided to put the two together and create something different than all of the other builds I see online. So after long months of research and planning for the best parts, I finally have a finished product that plays better than I could have ever imagined!

# History
The frankenstrat created by Eddie Van Halen was a product of Eddie's attempt to combine the sound of a Gibson Les Paul with the tremolo ability of a stratocaster. Most of the parts came from various guitars like his ES-335 and discounted parts that various guitar shops wanted to throw out for various reasons. As a result, Eddie collected these parts to create something never seen before.

# Full Build Timelaspe
To document the build process, I made a timelapse for each step including painting, routing, electronics, and polishing along with helpful hints for certain steps. Check it out below!

# Parts List with Part Selection Supplement
For this build, I was not going for a complete 1:1 recreation of the original guitar because I wanted something that resembled the original guitar but with certain additional parts that I would want on a guitar. 

## Body
While there is information online about what wood the original frankenstrat body was made from, there seems to be speculation that the wood was swamp ash, northern ash, or basswood. Since I did not know for sure, I ended up choosing swamp ash because after checking out videos on those three tonewoods, I eded up liking that sound the best. I chose swamp ash for its very resonant, strong, and sustain compared to other tonewoods. 

I chose an [eBay seller who fabricates custom guitar bodies](https://www.ebay.com/itm/326187569782) as this route was hundreds cheaper than buying a swamp ash body from a retailer.

## Hardware
For the various hardware on the guitar, parts like the pickguard were chosen to replicate the original look, while others like the tuners, toggle switch, etc were chosen based off of preference.

- [Strap Buttons]( https://www.ebay.com/itm/363382539717) 
- [3-way Selector Switch]( https://www.ebay.com/itm/112206021973) 
- [Frankenstrat Pickguard and Pot]( https://www.ebay.com/itm/264262142861) 
- [Jack Plate and Jack](https://www.ebay.com/itm/326397246645) 
- [Fender American Tuners]( https://www.ebay.com/itm/401133273129) 
- [Pickguard Screws]( https://www.ebay.com/itm/116208882312) 
- [Fender Neck Plate]( https://www.ebay.com/itm/196266445491)
  
## Neck
Just like with the body, it was actually hundreds cheaper to custom order a Kramer style hockeystick neck than it was to buy from a retailer. Especially since that type of headstock is more rare, the market price can get very high for these. I ended up ordering a custom neck from [Musikraft](https://musikraft.com/product/banana-neck-custom-build/) tailored to my preferred specifications:

- Head Shape: Holy Grail
- Scale Length: 25.5"
- Nut Width: 1-11/16" (42.8mm)
- Floyd Nut Rear Mounting Holes
- 2-1/4" (57.2mm) Heel Width (Go with Fender standard width for more compatibility) 
- Dual Acting Truss Rod @ Head
- Maple Fretboard
- 12" Neck Radius
- 055 Nickel Silver Frets (Medium Tall)
- Walnut Skunk Stripe
- MK Custom EVH 81 91 Back Profile
- Oil Finish (Same as Fender)
- Neck Holes with Standard Fender Pattern

## Tremolo
The original frankenstrat and Kramer had a Floyd Rose Original tremolo. While this tremolo is tried and true, the price is super high. Though, a guitar parts company Gotoh produces a Floyd Rose clone with notable improvements and full compatibility to the orgiginal Floyd as less than half the price. From my usage so far, the tremolo usit hold tune very well, even under the most extreme divebombs. Included below is also the locking nut needed and the EVH D-Tuna for on the fly drop D tuning without unscrewing the nut.

## Electronics
### Pickups
For the humbucker pickup, I ended up going with the Seymour-Duncan SH-11 Custom Custom as it was the same model that was inside Eddie's 80's Kramer guitar. For the red phenolic pickup in the neck, the original frankenstrat did not have it wired properly so it never worked. In my case, I bought a working pickup that I could wire to a toggle switch for more tonal possibilities.

### Switches
The original frankenstrat had a 3 way pickup selector in the middle position on the guitar body, this did not acttualy serve a purpose other than cosmetic. To make use of the neck pickup, I wired in a black 3 way toggle switch used in Les Paul guitars for more tonal possibilities.

# Build Process
## Paint
I referenced various photos and color matched the colors the best I could to spray paints that I could find at the hardware store. I found that Krylon gloss white, gloss black, and gloss red pepper paint + primer was the closest match and made the guitar pop.

Before painting, I sprayed a few coats of shellac on the body to prevent the porous swamp ash body from soaking up too much paint. This is a recommendation I saw online that heped out in the buffing process later since the body did not soak up a lot of paint or finish.

To paint the stripes, I used various sized painters tape to do this. First, I painted a black layer, added stripes, painted the white layer, added more tape, and added the final red layer. I loosely referenced the original frankenstrat and Kramer 5150 photos for stripe patterns that I would like to try and replicate.

### Body
Below shows some photos from the timelaspe video during the painting process.

## Poly Coat and Buffing
For the finish, I decided on polyurathane spray for its durability and fast drying times. After I applied many coats of polyurathane, I wet sanded all the way to 2000 grit sandpaper and used Guitar One polish with a microfiber towel and electric buffer for the flat parts to achieve a shiny finish. The wood itself was very grainy, so the poly coat took the shaoe of the various grooves and grain, but after polishing for a while it came out just fine.

## Routing
Just like the original frankenstrat, Eddie had channeled out the pickup holes in the body to be able to fit the humbucker and toggle switch. While there are bodies on the market with humbucker routings, I wanted to route my own cavities with a SSS stratocaster body.

<img width="776" height="391" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/13f30027-5850-4eca-8772-c20eefd78779" />

## Tremolo
Since the guitar body did not have routing for the floyd rose tremolo and holes for the posts. I carefully measured and used a template for the scale length from nut to tremolo to align and make sure there will be no intonation or playing issues. Since I don't normally use floating tremolos because I normally switch tunings, I opted for a decked setup where the tremolo can rest against the body always. This made tuning and intonation adjustment so much easier and faster. 

Thankfully, everything went smoothly!

## Electonics 
For the guitar wiring, I referenced this diagram from GuitarElectronics.com for a humbucker and single coil guitar with a single volume and 3 way toggle to make use of both pickups unlike the original frankenstrat with only the bridge pickup working.
